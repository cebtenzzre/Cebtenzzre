## About Me
- I'm a self-taught programmer in NYC.
- I have written many lines of C, C++, Python, bash, and zsh.
- I've seen enough segfaults to learn how to use GDB pretty well.
- I use Arch Linux daily, but I'm also comfortable with Debian and Ubuntu.
- Sometimes I dabble in electronic engineering.
- I have a ten-year-old Lenovo Thinkpad and I won't settle for anything newer.
