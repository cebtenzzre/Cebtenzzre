# Hi, I'm "Cebtenzzre"

## About Me
- I'm a self-taught programmer from upstate New York.
- I have written many lines of C, C++, Python, bash, and zsh.
- Because of the many footguns of C and C++, I've gotten pretty good at debugging weird segfaults and memory leaks with gdb and AddressSanitizer.
- Arch Linux is my operating system of choice, but I'm also comfortable with Debian and Ubuntu.
- Sometimes I dabble in electronic engineering, but I'm no expert.
- I like a variety of generes of music, new and old, and I'm always looking to find cool songs from bands I've never heard of.

## Projects & Contributions

- I wrote a little neural net trainer in PyTorch called [cebnn](https://github.com/Cebtenzzre/cebnn)
- Many random, small contributions to stuff I think is cool
